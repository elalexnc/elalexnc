### About

I work at the intersection of computational methods and physiological measurement. My research bridges structural bioinformatics (protein adaptation in extreme environments), psychophysiological measurement (EEG, HRV, CES), and the development of applied tools rooted in Endocentric Psychology.

Currently seeking **PhD opportunities in psychophysiology and health psychology**, with particular interest in labs integrating computational and physiological approaches to understanding human experience.

### Research

**Computational Molecular Evolution** — Used AlphaFold2 to investigate protein structural adaptation in cave-adapted shrimp (*Typhlatya*), comparing predicted structures and confidence metrics across surface and subterranean populations. Multivariate and gene-level analyses in R.

**Psychophysiological Measurement** — Experience developing and documenting EEG and CES (cranial electrotherapy stimulation) protocols for research contexts, with focus on non-invasive approaches and historical apparatus review.
